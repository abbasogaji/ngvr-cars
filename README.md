# CarsVR

Implementing Virtual Reality for a Car Dealership Web Application

## Introduction

The Car dealership web app will require 360 images of cars of all sides and will be reconstructed like a 3D model i.e 3D reconstruction, similar to Google Maps Images.

### The Major Issue
i Do not know how to do 3D reconstruction, but a friend of mine told me he worked on something similar using python and openCV, so and hoping perhaps will can be receiving i/o via a python API. if any suggestions please let me know

## Code Requirements
